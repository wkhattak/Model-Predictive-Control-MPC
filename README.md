# Project: Model Predictive Control (MPC)
## Overview
This project is about using [Model Predictive Control (MPC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_predictive_control) for controlling car steering angle & throttle.

## How Does It Work?

The MPC reframes the task of following a trajectory to an optimization problem by finding the best combination of steering angle & throttle values . The MPC is fed the initial state of the car [position, orientation, velocity, cross track error, orientation error]. Using the [Kinematic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinematics) vehicle model, actuator limitations and a cost function, the MPC then predicts the best possible actuator inputs (steering & throttle) by finding the lowest cost trajectory. 

## Rubric Points

### The Model

The MPC is based on the global Kinematic Model that is a simple real-time model easily applicable to different types of vehicle and accuracy wise is as good as its complex counterparts. It uses the current state of the car [position, orientation, velocity, cross track error, orientation error] and the actuator values [steering angle, throttle] for making future state & actuator predictions. Below are the equations that define the model:

Following steps illustrate the workings of the MPC:

1. Transform waypoints (provided by the simulator) from global co-ordinate system to vehicle co-ordinate system.
2. Fit a polynomial of order 3 to the transformed waypoints.
3. Calculate initial cross track & orientation errors.
4. Get the state after 100 ms & use the calculated state as current state to account for actuator latency.
5. Call the MPC solver.
6. Get the computed actuator values & the MPC predicted trajectory.  


### Timestep Length and Elapsed Duration (N & dt)

In MPC, the `T` is the *prediction horizon* in seconds, which is a product of *no. of timesteps* `N` and the *duration between each timestep* `dt`. Decreasing *dt* increases the frequency of actuation (the number of times steering & throttle is adjusted), which although results in a smoother trajectory e.g. in case of making a left or right turn, the computational cost increases and vice-versa. In case of *N*, an increase results in a large horizon meaning that the predictions are made for a longer time period. Setting a higher number means that it not only becomes computationally taxing but also somewhat a waste of computational resources as the car might not even maintain that trajectory due to changing environmental factors. Also depending upon *dt*, looking that far ahead might not be helpful if the trajectory is recomputed & gets changed with each timestep.

I tried different combinations of *N* & *dt* and in the end settled for values of `N=10` and `dt=0.1`. The table below shows the results of some of other combination of values:

| N | dt | Description   		| 
|:---:|:---:|:-------------------------------| 			
| 10 | 0.05 |Ok but very sharp turns & steering turning erratically even on straight road.|
| 20 | 0.05 |Crash straightaway.|
| 30 | 0.05 |Crash straightaway.|
| 5 | 0.05 |Worked for a bit then crashed. MPC trajectory pointing in totally different direction.|
| 5 | 0.1 |Worked for a bit then crashed. MPC trajectory pointing in totally different direction.|
| 20 | 0.1 |OK but it seems that on some occasions the MPC trajectory & the reference trajectory are not drawn properly & the car takes more extremes turns. Also this is more computationally taxing as the prediction horizon is large. Also, thereâ€™s no point in calculating points that are too much in future as they are simply thrown away with each successive call to the solver.|
